# Human-Activity-Recognition-WISDM
Human activity recognition using Neural Networks

Utilized python with Neural Networks for classifying human activities. 

Used data from 4 different senrors (Accelometer and Gyroscope by smartphone and smartwatch).

Key Features: Pandas, NumPy, Keras, TensorFlow, CuDNN, Sklearn, Matplotlib

Two different implementations. One for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and another one for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

Results (validation score):
CNN -->  83,43%
LSTM --> 83,61%
